---PLAN---

[checklist system: t = texture, c = code, wc = warcompatible //<-- last step]


Killstreaks:
[c]		add a variable that tells the number of kills (kills=0 if dead) 
	rewards:
[t]		2k	posion
[]		4k  care package (a chestminecart dropping from the sky; ) with a random killstreak inside
[t]		11k	attack dogs(dogs with modded ai)
[t]		7k	thunderStrike(we make the person get teleportet into the sky where from he clicks where he wants the thunder strike to go)
[t]		9k	TNTStrike(stuffs)
[t]		14k	juggernaut(u get diamond armor+sword, u get slowness_max)
[t]		20k	Nuke(spawns TNT on the zone sealing, which drops to the ground and kills everybody)

guns:
[t]		AssultRifle
[t]		bazooka shoots(we make an item shoot firecharges or firecharges from ghast //not sure if they are the same)
[t]		grenade launcher(we will make an item shoot an item which will explode on impact)
[t]		flamethrower(an automatic firearrow shooter; lowest range arrows; maybe spreadshot like the shotgun)
[t]		handgun(semi automatic; unlimited ammo)
[t]		shotgun(spreadshot; eats 4 arrows; shoots 10)
[t]		SMG
[t]		Rifle
[t]		Sniper
	
equipment:
[t]		c4(we make it possible to place TNT even though the destroyblcks is false; we add a "remote" wich activates the last block of tnt placed)
[t]		grenade(throwable; egg spawning a powered TNT) DONE!
[t]		stungrenade(throwable; lot of posions;) Leo knows...
[t]		smokegrenade(throwable; lots of smoke particles)  // maybe we should make it stop the fire of a molotov
[t]		molotov(throwable; spawns fire in a radius of 3 blocks [-2,-1;-2,0;-2,1;-1,-2;-1,-1;-1,0;-1,1;-1,2;0,-2;0,-1;0,0;0,1;0,2;1,-2;1,-1;1,0;1,1;1,2;2,-1;2,0;2,1];)
[t?]	tp endpearl (we add smoke to the position the player left)
	
extras:	
[t]    Scope(pumpkinblur)
(this should be added in toms original code)add an objective platform for war, which allows u to return flags here and destroy it with the bomb

classes/loadouts:
[t]		we make the loadouts of every person realative to items in an endchest, we do the same with killstrreaks
